description = "Simple hook to disable the damage indicator for overcharge damage.

Playing as Sienna becomes a wee bit annoying when the damage indicator flips about randomly when you cool down your staff.
This hook simply checks the damage type, and doesn't draw the indicator if the taken damage is of the overcharge type.

Thanks to NonzeroGeoduck7, whose Friendly Fire Indicator source I used as base for this mod. (And thanks for everyone involed in the modding framework!)
